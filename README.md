# AIDocu
An AI driven Documentation System

An AI-driven system primarily for documenting processes.
Our system can be used wherever documentation is required
or desired. 

Therefore we test models for the tool's usability and 
the emotional impact of a model.

We tested several models, including local ones. The largest model 
was OpenAI openai/gpt-oss-120b, which, while fast and powerful, 
was too limited  in its tool capabilities and lacked emotional 
appeal. A powerful tool is useless if it refuses to perform tasks. 
We now have a young favorite among the models. Stay tuned!
